All use our back-end RESTful API. Our System architecture is based around Windows Azure VMs, Azure NoSQL Tables, and a C# back-end REST system. We utilize Hadoop clusters (HD Insight) for the large amounts of data generated by clients. <br> <br> Naturally, we desire a developer with solid skills building systems that integrate Windows Azure tables, MongoDB or other NoSQL system. Previous experience designing and developing an efficient REST API is important. Offering a Query language through the RESTful API is important. LINQ experience or equivalent is very helpful. Your back-end also talks to Facebook, Twitter and other 3rd parties. Threading, waiting, synching, flagging, string concats, regex, blocking/non-blocking , Authing, Hashing, GUIDing and so forth are the things you dream about. Tell us about your fastest server; how many users did it support and how many transactions per second did it service.<br> <br> Your C# skills should be excellent. Nevertheless, we prefer a developer born in the C/C++ world opposed to pure C#. In this area, you would have used a variety of http and server libraries. Examples include FastCGI, Curl, String operations, URL encoding/decoding, etc. Please list your C/C++ library experience in your resume. You should have some Java experience in order to integrate Hadoop with our back-end. In this area, GREP, Regex Regular expression and SQL experience is helpful.\u00a0 Azure exposure is not essential; you might have Amazon AWS experience with DynamoDB, S3 storage, and Machine Images as an alternative to the Azure world. Please list your Cloud experience.<br> <br> We\u2019re a small team, so you need to be self-directed and resourceful. You also need to be open, communicative and available to the various developers using your RESTful API. Your documentation requirements are light but necessary. The clearer your written descriptions; the less questions you will need to answer.
